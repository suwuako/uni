# Context switching!

what happens when an interrupt (context switch) occurs?
- hardware stacks program counter
- hardware loads new program counter from interrupt vector
- assembly lanauge saves registers
- assembly language sets up new stack
- C interrupt service runs
- scheduler decides which process is to run next
- C procedure returns to assembly code 
- assembly language starts up new process

But what actually is a context switch??

a context switch can either mean:
- a swithc between threads
    - saving, restoring state associated with a thread
- a switch between processes
    - thread switch stuff and on top of that with the extra process state stuff (memory)

## When do context switches happen?

- when a syscall happens
- on an exception
- on an interrupt
    - includes timing interrupts (schedulers!)

A thread swtich can happen between any two instructions!

## How do we preform a context switch?

the goal is to create a thread that we can context swithc away from, and to be context 
switched back to. The userleverl thread won't notice this switch. That means that when
we suspend a thread, we need to take all its context (the stuff that explains what its
instructions mean, like registers, sp, pc) and restore its memory.

## os161?

in os161, we have a thread switch mechanism where a thread can choose to participate in,
which causes its stack to be suspended and transferred to another thread.

## Cooperative concurrency
