# os161 mips

We are using mips r3000!

- risc architecture (reduced isa)
- some instruction shave imediate operands
    - values are constants within the instruction itself
    - `addi r2, r1, 2048`
    - instruction format: | ADD | IMM | R2 | R1 | 2048 |
- registers!
    - 32 general purpose registers
    - r0 hardwired to 0
    - r31 is a jal (jump and link)
    - hi/lo are two 32 bits for multiply and divide
    - PC is the program counter

## Branches and jmumping

- branches and jumping have a branch delay slot
    - the instruction following a branch or jump is always executed
    prior to destination of jump
    - this means that the instruction after the jump or branch is
    executed ontop before the branch happens

### why does this happen?

- there are stages of executing an instruction!
    0. load instruction
    1. register file
    2. load into ALU
    3. D-cache
    4. register fileo
- the instructions don't get loaded at the same time!

instruction 1: ------| IF | RD | ALU | MEM | WB |----------------------------

instruction 2: --------------| IF | RD | ALU | MEM | WB |--------------------

instruction 3: ----------------------| IF | RD | ALU | MEM | WB |------------


## jump and link 

- used to implement function calls
- return register `ra` is used to return from function call

## mips register conventions

- (2-3) v0-v1: value returned by subroutine
- (4-7) a0-a3: first four parameters for subroutine
- (16-23) s0-s7: subroutine variables which must store and restore it
- (28) gp: global pointer for some systems to maintained to the global point
- (29) sp: stack pointer

## jumping to subroutines

when we switch/jump to a subroutine, we push the values we want to save to the stack
before we jump! doing this repeatedly we can create stack frames on stack frames so we
preserve the state of the current subprocess even if we call other processes.

# context switches

- a context switch can refer to:
    - a switch between threads
        - saving, restoring state associated with a thread
    - a switch between processes
