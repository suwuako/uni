* mod
  recall the div theorem: it states that for any int a and b, a can be represented as:

  $a = qb + r$

  same as modulo operator in compsc
  ** modular congruence:
     when we look at modulos, there are infinite many ints (x) that can give x mod 4 = 3. These numbers have something in common, and belong ot the same class; instead of saying 19 mod 4 = 47 mod 4, you can write a (congruent) b 


     $a \\mod 3 = 4, b \\mod 3 = 4$
     $a \\equiv b$
