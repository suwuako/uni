= set notation =

defiinition: a set is a defined, unordered collection of distinct objects
notation: a set can be representing its elements surrounded by curly braces

since sets are unordered, S = {3, 1, 2} = {1, 2, 3}

since elements are distinct, repetiton is ignored so the set S can be written as S = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3} = {1, 2, 3}

elements of a set can be numbers, letters or any other object

= defining sets =
notation: the set membership symbol ∈ is used to indicated to say that it is an element of a set

x ∈ S means x is an element of S we can also use the symbol 

= numeric sets =
we have our average sets for numbers
N -> natural nums {0, 1, 2...}
Z -> integers {-1, 0, 1...}
Z+ -> positive ints (i.e. natural nums without 0) {1, 2, 3...}
Q -> set of rational numbs (all ints and fracs)
R -> set of real (all nums on real number line)
C -> complex

= empty set & cardinality =
A = {x ∈ N | x < 5} -> {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {n ∈ Z | n^2 = 4} -> {-2, 2}
C = {x ∈ Z+ | x/2 ∈ Z} -> {2, 4, 6, 8...}
D = {2k : k ∈ Z+} = {2, 4, 6, 8...}
E = {x ∈ D : x !∈ R} = {}

definition: set with no elements is the empty set, which is written as {} or o/
definition: the cardinality or size of a set is the number of distinct elements it contains; we write |S to mean the cardinality of set S.
tkae A = {1, 2, 3}, thus |A| = 3

= sets within sets =
sets can contain elements of any type; meaning that sets can be in other sets
if we think of tuts as sets of students, then the set of all math tuts is a set containing sets

for the set S= {1, 2, {3, 4}}, it contains 1, 2, and {3, 4}. this means that {3, 4} ∈ S. This means the cardinality is |S| = 3

The elements aren't related to the lements of S nor the cardinality of S, meaning that 3 !∈ S

gonna handwrite notes or use latex
