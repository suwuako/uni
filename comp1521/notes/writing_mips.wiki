most cpu archs preform operations over registers
part of the processor, not memory
its faster, faster than memory
caches store memory for faster access

== registers? ==
- mips has 32 registers
- 32 bits each
- program counter:
    - keeps track of what instruciton to be handled
    - modified by branch and jump instructions

main:
    li      $t3, 7
    li      $t4, 9
    muil    $t1, $t3, $t4
    
    li      $v0
    jr      $ra
    
li loads magic numbers into a register
la copies addresses into a register
move moves contents of a register into another
