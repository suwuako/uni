= your first program =

byte - 1 byte
half word - 2 bytes
word - 4 byte quantity
quad - 8 bytes

sw - store value into a dereferenced pointer:
sw $t1, ($t2)

stores the value of t1 into the address of t2

== labels ==
we can tell mipsy to create space given a label:

x:
    .space 4
    
stores 4 byes at the address of x

la lets you load the address of a given label into a register

you can add a nuber to the register to go backwards or forwards by that register:

```mipsy
lw      $a0, 0($t1)
```

== arrays ==
take note of the sizeof each item; an array of words should be indexed by:
address:index * sizeof(item)

    mul     $t1, $t0, 4
    sw      $v0, arr($t1)

=== 2d arrays: ===
