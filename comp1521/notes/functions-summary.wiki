frame pointer ($fp)

the frame pointer points at the bottom of a given function's stack frame
i.e. it points to the same value as $sp before a function does any pushes/pops

we are given begin and end:
begin saves the old $fp to the stack
sets $fp to the current $sp
should be the first thing in the epilogue

end:
restore $sp to point to the top of the previous stack frame
restore $fp to pint to the previous value of $fp
should be right before jr $ra
